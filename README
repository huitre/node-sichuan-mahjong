Sichuan Mahjong server plus minimal client in node.js

Installation:
The server currently doesn't need any other modules to be installed.

Use:
1- Run node on server.js
2- Visit http://localhost:8080/
3- Hit the "New Game" button
4- Open a new window, same URL
5- Hit the "List Games" button
6- Select game in drop down menu
7- Repeat steps 4- to 6- 2 more times
8- Ready up
9- Choose a "secret" suit
10- Enjoy!

All interactions are done using the drop down menu.

Disclaimer:
This is obviously a work in progress.
It was and is a way for me to get to learn nodejs.
The only external thing used is choreographer.js by Han which I have slightly changed to suit it to my use.
Do not hesitate to contribute. : )

Future:
- WebSockets:
From my POV, WebSockets are more adequate for this kind of server.
I intended to complete a Comete version before going into WebSockets.
It would most definitly simplify client-server communications code though.
- Visual Client:
I have visual assets for the tiles but being no big front programmer I will try to thoroughly finish the server first.
- Suggestions?
